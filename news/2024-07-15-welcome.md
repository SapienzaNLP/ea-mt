Welcome to the **SemEval 2025 - Task 2: EA-MT** website! We are excited to announce the launch of the website and the release of the training data. We are looking forward to your participation in the shared task. Stay tuned for more updates!

## SemEval 2025
SemEval is a series of international natural language processing (NLP) research workshops whose mission is to advance the current state of the art in semantic analysis and to help create high-quality annotated datasets in a range of increasingly challenging problems in natural language semantics. You can find more information about SemEval on the [official website](https://semeval.github.io/).

## Entity-Aware Machine Translation
The focus of Task 2 in SemEval 2025 is on Entity-Aware Machine Translation (EA-MT). The goal of this task is to develop machine translation systems that can accurately translate text that includes potentially challenging named entities in the source language.
