Stay tuned for more updates!\\n\\n## SemEval 2025\\nSemEval is a series of international natural language processing (NLP) research workshops whose mission is to advance the current state of the art in semantic analysis and to help create high-quality annotated datasets in a range of increasingly challenging problems in natural language semantics. You can find more information about SemEval on the [official website](https://semeval.github.io/).\\n\\n## Entity-Aware Machine Translation\\nThe focus of Task 2 in SemEval 2025 is on Entity-Aware Machine Translation (EA-MT). The goal of this task is to develop machine translation systems that can accurately translate text that includes potentially challenging named entities in the source language.\\n\\n![Background Image](/img/background-blurred.jpg)\\n\\n### Task Description\\nWe invite participants to read the [task description](/docs/category/the-ea-mt-task) for an updated overview of the task.\\n\\n## Important Dates\\nHere are the important dates for the shared task:\\n- Sample data ready: **15 July 2024**\\n- Training data ready: **2 September 2024**\\n- Evaluation start: **10 January 2025**\\n- Evaluation end: by **31 January 2025**\\n- System paper submission due: **28 February 2025**\\n- Task paper submission due: **7 March 2025**\\n- Notification to authors: **31 March 2025**\\n- Camera ready due: **21 April 2025**\\n- SemEval workshop: Summer 2025 (co-located with a major NLP conference)\\n\\n:::info Timezone\\nAll deadlines are 23:59 UTC-12 (\\"anywhere on Earth\\").\\n:::\\n\\n## Stay Connected\\nPlease, stay tuned for more updates on the EA-MT task for SemEval-2025.
